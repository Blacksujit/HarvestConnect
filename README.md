# HarvestConnect

## Connecting Farmers. Nourishing Communities. 

# Problem statement:

## Consumers: 

Difficulty accessing fresh, locally-grown produce at competitive prices. Limited transparency about farming practices and the origin of food.


## Farmers: 

Difficulty reaching new customers beyond local markets. Reliance on middlemen who take a significant cut of profits. Lack of control over product pricing and distribution.


# Our Solution :

This farmer management system is a two-way platform that facilitates direct interaction and product purchase between consumers and farmers. It aims to minimize the market gap, ensuring fairer prices for farmers and fresher, locally sourced products for consumers.
